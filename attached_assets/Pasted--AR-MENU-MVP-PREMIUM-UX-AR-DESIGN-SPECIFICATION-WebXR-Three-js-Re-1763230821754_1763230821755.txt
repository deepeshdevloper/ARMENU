## **2.2 Category Lens Rings Screen (Hero Screen)**

### Purpose

Provide food categories in an immersive Snapchat-style ring selector.

---

### Overall Feel

This screen must feel **alive**, **interactive**, and **Gen-Z premium** — like TikTok filters or Snapchat Lens selection but adapted for food categories.

---

### Layout

* Fullscreen
* Centered horizontal carousel of floating **3D donut rings**
* Each ring:

  * 3D torus-like glowing donut
  * Food preview model lightly spinning inside the donut opening
  * Neon glow matching category theme:

    * Spicy = electric crimson
    * Dessert = pastel pink
    * Drinks = aqua neon
    * Veg = bright green
* Category title under each ring (floating text with subtle parallax)

---

### Micro-Interactions

#### **Idle animation**

* Rings float up and down ±3px
* Slow 360° rotation on Y-axis over 12 seconds
* Subtle wobble every 4 seconds (organic, playful)

#### **Hover / Tap animation** (mobile-first)

* Ripple distortion emanates from the center like TikTok filters
* Glow intensifies
* Ring scale increases from 1.0 → 1.08 quickly
* Food preview spins slightly faster for 1 second

#### **Selection animation**

* Selected ring expands to 1.2 scale
* Non-selected rings fade to 40% opacity
* Background blurs with depth-of-field effect
* Screen transitions into Dish List with smooth upward slide

---

## **2.3 Dish List Screen**

### Purpose

Show all dishes in the selected category in a unique, creative, appetizing layout.

---

### Layout

Choose the most engaging pattern for a food experience:

#### **Option A — Vertical “Stacked Cards” Carousel**

* Each dish card is slightly rotated (like a deck of cards)
* Foremost card is in focus, rest staggered behind
* Swipe or scroll vertically to bring next card forward

#### **Option B — Horizontal “Liquid Swipe” Cards**

* Cards animate like liquid blobs transitioning into each other
* Great for Gen-Z design

#### **Option C — Elevated Parallax List**

* Each card tilts based on phone tilt (gyroscope parallax)

---

### Dish Card Structure

Each card contains:

* Thumbnail image (high contrast)
* Dish name (big, bold typography)
* Short 1-line description
* Emojis representing mood (🔥 spicy, 🍫 dessert, 🍋 tangy)
* “View in AR” button
* Micro shadows and neon elements matching category color

---

### Micro-Interactions

* Cards slightly bounce upward on scroll end
* “View in AR” button glows subtly
* Thumbnail zooms 3% on hover
* When selecting dish:

  * Card expands
  * Background slightly dims
  * Transition to AR readiness screen

---

### States

* **List Loaded**
* **Dish Selected**
* **Loading AR Assets**
* **Back to Categories**

---

## **2.4 View Dish in AR — Pre-AR Screen**

### Purpose

Prepare user for AR mode before entering WebXR session.

### Layout

* Clean panel with dish name, calories, 1–2 photos
* “Enter AR” button (prominent neon outline)
* Warning text:
  **“Point your camera at a flat table or plate. The 3D dish will only appear when a real surface is detected.”**

### Micro-Interactions

* Button gently pulses every 2 seconds
* Photos slide slightly on tilt (parallax)

---

# 3. AR EXPERIENCE SPECIFICATION (CORE OF MVP)

---

## **3.1 Entering AR Mode**

### Motion

* Fade UI
* Camera feed appears
* Three.js renderer activates
* Reticle appears only when hit-test finds a surface

---

## **3.2 Plane Detection Rules**

This is the MOST important MVP rule:

### **The dish model MUST NOT appear until a valid horizontal surface (table/plate) is detected.**

### Conditions for “valid plane”:

* Plane normal must be facing upward
* Angle tolerance: max tilt ≤ 20°
* Minimum hit-test stability:

  * Hit-test must be consistent for 300–600ms
* If no valid plane for 6 seconds → show “No Table” guidance screen

---

## **3.3 Reticle Design**

* Circular thin glowing ring
* Dot in center
* Neon color matches dish category (consistent theme)
* Pulses lightly when plane becomes stable
* Reticle has two states:

### **Reticle States**

1. **Searching for surface (No plane)**

   * Reticle hidden
   * “Move your device slowly…” text appears

2. **Valid plane found**

   * Reticle visible
   * Glow intensifies
   * Small bounce animation indicating placement possible

---

## **3.4 Placement Interaction**

### How placement works:

* User taps anywhere while reticle is visible
* Dish model spawns anchored to plane
* Model scale applied smoothly from 0 → full scale (0.4 sec ease-out animation)
* Info Overlay appears after placement

---

## **3.5 AR Dish Interaction Rules**

### Scaling (Pinch Gesture)

* Pinch in/out to shrink/grow
* Limit scale to 0.5× → 2.0×

### Rotation (Two-Finger Rotate)

* Smooth rotation proportional to twist angle
* Slight easing applied to make movement feel natural

### Position Lock

* Once placed, dish stays anchored
* To move: user must remove & re-place (simple for MVP)

---

## **3.6 Info Overlay UI**

Small floating panel at top or bottom:

* Dish name
* Calories
* Ingredients
* “Reposition Dish” button
* “Exit AR” button

Overlay automatically dims after 3 seconds of inactivity.

---

## **3.7 Exiting AR**

* Fade out camera feed
* Fade in Dish List screen
* Dispose AR session gracefully

---

# 4. FAILURE + EDGE CASE UX

---

## **4.1 No Table Detected State**

After 6 seconds of scanning:

### UI

* Modal overlay
* Animated illustration showing phone scanning table
* Instructions:
  **“We couldn’t find a flat surface. Move your camera slowly or try pointing at a well-lit table.”**

### Buttons

* Retry AR
* Back to Dish screen

---

## **4.2 Low Light Warning**

If surface contrast is insufficient:

* Non-intrusive toast:
  **"More lighting may help detect surfaces."**

---

## **4.3 Device Unsupported**

If WebXR is not available:

* Show 3D interactive viewer instead (orbit controls)
* Explain:
  **“Your device does not support AR. Showing 3D view instead.”**

---

# 5. VISUAL DESIGN SYSTEM

---

## **5.1 Color Style**

Primary colors match food moods.

* Spicy → Red
* Dessert → Pink
* Drinks → Aqua
* Veg → Green
* Gravy Items → Orange
* Premium Items → Gold

---

## **5.2 Typography**

* Headings: Bold, wide spacing, modern feel
* Body text: Rounded, friendly, mobile-optimized
* Buttons: Rounded edges, neon outer glow

---

## **5.3 Motion Guidelines**

* Transitions never exceed 500ms
* Always ease-out or cubic-bezier for premium feel
* Avoid sharp mechanical animations
* Everything must feel like “liquid flow” and “neon glow”

---

## **5.4 Haptics (Mobile)**

* Light vibration on ring tap
* Stronger tap when model is placed in AR

---

# 6. PERFORMANCE GUIDELINES

---

## **6.1 AR Performance**

* Models optimally < 5 MB
* Use compressed glTF
* Texture resolution minimal to avoid lag
* Keep shadows simple or baked
* Keep materials PBR but lightweight

---

## **6.2 Loading Optimization**

* Preload low-res model preview
* Load full model only when entering AR

---

# 7. PRIVACY + PERMISSIONS

---

## **7.1 Permissions Modal**

Before AR:

* “We only use your camera for AR surface detection. No footage is stored.”

---
